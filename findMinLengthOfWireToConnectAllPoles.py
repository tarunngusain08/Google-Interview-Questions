# Letâ€™s say you are given with n electricity poles in a line. Each pole i has a flexible varying height from 1 to maximum MaxHeight(i) .
# MaxHeights are defined in a separate array MaxHeight[1...n].
# These poles can vary their size (expand to max height / shrink to lowest height 1) at any time.

# You need to write code to find out the length of wire you would need to connect all these poles from top,
# such that no matter how much is the current height of each pole, the wire should be able to connect all these poles from top.
# What is the minimum wire length required to sufficiently connect these poles from top in any configurations of poles ?
