# When a person who knows it meets any other person, they immediately share the story with them.
# Initially, only person 1 knows the story. Given a list of meetings between people in a form of
# (person_1_id, person_2_id, timestamp) construct a list of the persons who will know the story
# at the very end.

# Example: [(1, 2, 100), (3,4, 200), (1,3, 300), (2,5, 400)], 1 // The events could be out of order.
# Person 2 will learn the story at the moment 100, person 3 — at the moment 300,
# person 5 — in the moment 400. Person 4 will never learn the story. So the answer is [1, 2, 3, 5].

# Eg2: [(1, 2, 100), (2, 3, 100), (4, 5, 100)], 2
# where the first parameter is array of the Persons meet at particular timestamp, second parameter is the PersonId who knows the story first.
# Output: [1, 2, 3]
